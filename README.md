# Mathematical-Cryptography

This repository contains Python implementation of algorithms that are used almost everywhere in Mathematical Cryptography. There are seceral basic algorithms that are used in cryptography over and over again. The ones we are focusing on right now are:
- ![Euclidean Algorithm](euclideanalgo.py) 
- ![Binary Euclidean Algorithm](bineuclid.py)
- ![Extended Euclidean Algorithm](eea.py)
-
