# Mathematical-Cryptography

This repository contains Python implementation of algorithms that are used almost everywhere in Mathematical Cryptography. There are seceral basic algorithms that are used in cryptography over and over again. The ones we are focusing on right now are:

- [Euclidean gcd Algorithm](euclideanalgo.py) 
- [Binary Euclidean Algorithm](bineuclid.py)
- [Extended Euclidean Algorithm](eea.py)

[The Euclidean Algorithm](euclideanalgo.py): The case of integers is considered only since it can be easily generalized to polynomials due to the fact that both integers and polynomials allow Euclidean division.
As an example we consider a few examples:
> Case 1: For Small Numbers:

> Case 2: For larger numbers:
